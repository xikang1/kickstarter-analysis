# Data analysis on Kickstarter program
## Overiew of Project
In this report, We are focusing on data analysis of the trend relationships that how different campaigns related to their launch dates and funding goals by Lousie's data collection of several thousand crowdfunding projects. We are going to reveal the relationships by using professional Excel skills to Lousie, and we are visualizing the trends to solid graphs with clear views.

### Purpose
We are using the dataset to analyze how the launch dates and funding goals affect the result of fundraising different campaigns. After visualization, we could find the uncovered trends based on the result.

### Analysis and Challenges Encountered
During the process of data analysis, everything went great except for a couple of things. Firstly, I have generated the graph Outcomes Based on Goal that is almost the same as the sample shown in the module but the percentage sign. After some attempts, I went to the home page and selected all three rows including percentage successful, failed, and canceled, and change the data type from general to percentage. The percentage sign showed up successfully on my graph. On the other hand, I have learned how to use the functions like year function and countifs function. The contifs function instruction is slightly different from what is showed in the module videos. I have worked it out by typing the contifs function and observed the variable instructions shown afterward in the formula bar to input appropriate variables like the range and criteria to let the function work properly. So for next time, if I need to use a new function I have never seen before, I would like to just simply type the function in the formula bar and I could input the correct variables by referring to the variable hint.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Dates
![](resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) As we can see from the above graph, the success of the theater campaign started to rise in April and had reached a peak which is about 110 campaigns in May. The difference between success and failure of campaigns maximized in May as well. The difference is relatively small in the time period from January to April and from August to December comparing the period from May to July which indicates that the launch date would affect the result significantly in Summer from May to July. It is not playing a crucial role in the rest of the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
![](resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) As the outcomes based on goals shown above with the blue line indicating the percentage successful while the green line and dark blue line indicating the percentage failed and percentage canceled respectively. The chance of goal achieved successfully is keep decreasing from about 80% to just about 20% as the goal is from less than 1000 up to the range between 25,000 to 29,999 dollars. It roars up to about 70% chance of success when the goal ranged from 35,000 to 44,999 dollars. Once the goal is over 45,000 dollars, the chance of being successful becomes low again. As failure is complementary to success, the chance of goal failure is the opposite as the goal succeeded.

## Results

### Conclusions about the Outcomes based on Launch Dates
First of all, we should start the theater fundraising projects in Summer from May to August especially in May to maximize the chance of being successful. On the other hand, if we only observe the failed samples, we should try to avoid holding theater projects in October and December because the gap difference between success and failure is relatively small so that it would be difficult to achieve the goal.

### Conclusions about the Outcomes based on Goals
It is better to set the goal within a reasonable range like from less than 1000 up to about 15,000 dollars. Despite when the range is from 35,000 to 44,999, the chance of meeting the goal is more than 60%, the chance decreases dramatically when the funding goal is over 45,000 dollars. The reason behind this is that when the amount of funding goal is over some range, it is more difficult to accomplish the goal. We should set a proper amount of funding goal base on different situations.

### limitations of the dataset and recommendations for addtional tables and graphs
Even though there are 4115 project samples in our dataset, the size of samples is still considered to be insufficient to make an accurate analysis of the trends and relationships between the chance of being successful and other factors. Besides, I suggest focusing on analyzing the relationship between the parent categories and the outcomes. We can know which categories are playing an important role in the collection of the fund. Furthermore, we can continue to work on the analysis of the launch dates from those popular categories so that we could raise more funds in a proper time period more effectively.
