# Data analysis on Kickstarter program
## Overiew of Project
In this report, We are forcusing on data analysis of the trend relationships that how different campaigns related to their launch dates and funding goals by Lousie's data collection of serveral thousand corwdfunding projects. We are going to reveal the relationships by using professional Excel skills to Lousie, and we are visualizing the trends to solid graphs with clear views.

### Purpose
We are using the dataset to analysis how the launch dates and funding goals affect the result of fundraising differnt campaigns.After visuaization, we need to make the conlcusion based on the result.

### Analysis and Challenges Encountered
During the process of data analysis, everything went great expcet for couple things. Firstly, I have generated the graph Outcomes Based on Goal that is almost same as the sample shown in the module but the percentage sign. After some attempts, I went to the home page and selected all three rows includingpercentage successul,failed and canceled,and change the data type from general to percentage. The percentage sign showed up successfully on my graph. On the other hand, I have learned how to use the functions like year function and countifs function. The contifs function instruction are silghtly different from what is showed in the vedios. I have worked it out by typing the contifs function and observed the variable instructions shown afterward in the formula bar to input appropriate variables like the range and criteria to let the function work properly. So for next time, if I need to use a new function I have never seen before, I would like to just simply type the function in the formula bar and I could input the correct vairables by refering the variable hint.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Dates
![](resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) As we can see from above graph, the success of theater campaign started to rise in April and had reached the peak which is about 110 campaigns in May. The difference between success and failure of campagins maximized in May as well. The difference is relatively  small in the time period from January to April and from August to Decemeber comparing the the period from May to July which indicateds that the launch date would affect the result significantly specially in Summer from May to July. It is not playing a curcial role in the rest of the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
![](resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) As the outcomes based on goals shown above with the blue line indicating the percentage successful while the green line and dark blue line indicating the percentage failed and percenage cancelled respectively. The chance of goal achieved sucessful is keep decreasing from about 80% tojust about 20% as the goal is from less than 1000 up to the range between 25,000 to 29,999 dollars.It roars up to about 70% chance of success when the goal ranged from 35,000 to 44,999 dollars. Once the goal is over 45,000 dollars, the chance of being successful becomes low again. As failure is complementary to success, the chance of goal failed is opposite as the goal succeeded.

## Results

### Conclusions about the Outcomes based on Launch Dates
First of all, we should start the theater fundraising projects in Summer from May to August especially in May to maximize the chance of being successful. On the other hand, if we only observe the failed samples, we should try to aovid holding theater projects in October and December because of the gap difference of success and failure is realtively small so that it would be difficult to acheive the goal.

### Conclusions about the Outcomes based on Goals
It is better to set the goal within a reasonalbe range like from less than 1000 up to about 15,000 dollars. Despite when the range is from 35,000 to 44,999, the chance of meeting the goal is more than 60%, the chance decreases dramatically when the funding goal is over 45,000 dollars. The reason behind this is that when the amoung of funding goal is over some range, it is more diffuclt to accomplish the goal. We should set proper amount of funding goal base on different situations.
